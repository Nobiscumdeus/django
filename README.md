# Arduino-Django Sensor Monitoring System

This project integrates Arduino with Django to monitor and display sensor data on a web page in real-time. It utilizes AJAX for real-time observation of sensor data updates and Celery for occasional deletion of details that are long stored to reduce the weight/load on the database.

## Overview

The Arduino-Django Sensor Monitoring System is designed to collect, store, and visualize sensor data in real-time. It combines the capabilities of Arduino microcontrollers for sensor data collection with Django web framework for data storage and web interface development.

### Key Features:

- **Real-time Sensor Data Monitoring**: Users can monitor sensor data updates in real-time through a web-based dashboard.
- **AJAX for Real-time Updates**: AJAX technology is utilized to fetch sensor data updates without the need to refresh the entire web page, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Celery for Periodic Database Cleanup**: Celery is used to perform periodic database cleanup tasks, removing old sensor data to optimize database performance.
- **Mock Data Support**: In addition to real-time data from Arduino, mock data is provided to simulate sensor readings in case Arduino is not available or for testing purposes.
  
## Components

- **Arduino**: Collects sensor data from connected sensors and sends it to the Django backend via serial communication.
- **Django Backend**: Receives sensor data from Arduino or mock data, stores it in the database, and serves it to the web interface.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built using Django templates, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to visualize sensor data and monitor changes in real-time.
- **AJAX**: Facilitates real-time updates of sensor data on the web interface without the need for page refresh.
- **Celery**: Manages periodic tasks, such as database cleanup, to optimize system performance and resource utilization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-django-sensor-monitoring.git
cd arduino-django-sensor-monitoring
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure Arduino:

   - Connect the sensors to the Arduino board.
   - Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the `arduino/` directory to the Arduino board.

4. Configure Django:

   - Update the database settings in `settings.py` to connect to your preferred database.
   - Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the Django server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

6. Start Celery worker and beat (for periodic tasks):

```bash
celery -A your_project_name worker -l info
celery -A your_project_name beat -l info
```

7. Access the web interface:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the web interface for monitoring sensor data.

## Mock Data Usage

In case Arduino is not available or for testing purposes, mock data can be used to simulate sensor readings. The mock data is provided in the Django backend and can be configured to mimic various sensor readings.

To use mock data:

- Ensure that Arduino is not connected or disabled in the configuration.
- Mock data will be automatically loaded when the Django server is started.
- You can customize and adjust the mock data in the Django admin interface or by modifying the mock data files directly.
